# Steps for running zhbb analyzer
 - open zhbb_analyze.cpp and institute any cuts at the top of the main function
 - open do_zhbb.sh and change the paths at the top to suit your file system
 - run 'make' to compile zhbb_analyze.cpp into an executable
 - ensure all samples being used are listed in input_files.txt
 - make a corresponding directory within the histograms directory for each sample directory being used (ensure they are all different)
 - add the each directory and its corresponding cross section to get_cross_section.h
 - run 'python modify_input_names.py' to generate the automatically argument lists (output in modified_files.txt) from the input files listed
 - copy one entry from modified_files.txt into test.txt
 - run 'condor_submit test_submit.sub' and check that the submission worked by viewing the job output in the condor directory
 - once the test submission runs correctly, proceed by running 'condor_submit submit_zhbb.sub'
 - open 'do_hadding.sh' and edit the hadding to fit your file system, sample directories, and background categories
 - open 'draw_zhbb.C' and edit the background files accordingly and checking that the plots will be output where you want them
 - run draw_zhbb.C by running 'root -l -b' followed by '.x draw_zhbb.C(*insert arguments*)'
 - check output to reorder the background categories if needed
